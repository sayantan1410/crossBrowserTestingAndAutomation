### 🌐 Multi-Browser Web Scraper
A sophisticated parallel web scraping system that extracts and analyzes content across multiple browser configurations simultaneously. This project demonstrates advanced concurrent programming, cross-browser compatibility testing, and automated content extraction with translation capabilities.


### ✨ Features

🔄 Parallel Processing: 5 concurrent threads running different browser configurations
🌍 Multi-Browser Support: Tests across different browsers and device types (Desktop, Mobile, Tablet)
📝 Content Extraction: Automatically extracts headlines, paragraphs, and images
🔤 Translation: Built-in translation capabilities for international content
📊 Analysis: Word frequency analysis and content comparison
📁 Organized Output: Structured file organization with capability-specific folders
🚀 CI/CD Ready: GitHub Actions workflow integration


### 🚀 Quick Start
Prerequisites

Python 3.8 or higher
Git
Internet connection for web scraping

### Installation

Clone the repository
bashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/multi-browser-scraper.git
cd crossBrowserTestingAndAutomation

Create a virtual environment
python -m venv scraper_env

##### On macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv scraper_env

Activate the virtual environment
##### On Windows
scraper_env\Scripts\activate

##### On macOS/Linux
source scraper_env/bin/activate

Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the scraper
python bstack_main.py


### 🎯 How It Works

Initialization: The system spawns 5 parallel threads, each configured with different browser capabilities
Concurrent Scraping: Each thread independently navigates to the target website and extracts content
Content Processing: Headlines, paragraphs, and images are extracted and processed
Translation: Non-English content is automatically translated
Analysis: Word frequency and content analysis is performed
Output Generation: Results are logged with capability identifiers and saved to organized folders

### 🔧 Configuration
Browser Capabilities
The scraper tests 5 different browser configurations:

Capability 1: Desktop Chrome (Windows)
Capability 2: Mobile Safari (iOS)
Capability 3: Desktop Firefox (macOS)
Capability 4: Mobile Chrome (Android)
Capability 5: Tablet Safari (iPad)

### Customization
To modify target websites or capabilities, edit the config.json file:
CAPABILITIES = {
    1: {"browser": "chrome", "device": "desktop"},
    2: {"browser": "safari", "device": "mobile"},
    # Add more configurations...
}
### 📈 Expected Output
The scraper produces interleaved output showing parallel execution:
Capability 1 - [1] Heading: Sample Article Title
Capability 3 - [1] Heading: Sample Article Title
Capability 1 - [2] Heading: Another Article
Capability 2 - [1] Heading: Sample Article Title
...

This demonstrates successful concurrent processing across multiple browser environments.
### 🧪 Testing with GitHub Actions
This project includes CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions. The workflow automatically:

Sets up the Python environment
Installs dependencies
Runs the scraper
Stores results as artifacts
